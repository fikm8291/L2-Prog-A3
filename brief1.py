# Assessment 3: Emergency Call Logger
# North West Ambulance Service (Brief 1)
# -------------------------------------------
# Think carefully about how to structure your code, validate user input,
# and present information clearly to the user.
#
# Remember to save, stage, commit, and push after completing each task.
# -------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------
# TODO
# -------------------------------------------
# 1. Delete the other briefs' Python files inside this repository.
# 2. Rename this file to your own program's name (e.g. tax_calculator.py)
# 3. Run:
#    git add .
#    git commit -m "Started project"
#    git push origin main
# -------------------------------------------

# Task 1: Data Storage
# -------------------------------------------
# Decide how your program will store all emergency call records.
# Each record should capture key details of a single call.
# Choose a suitable data structure and initialise it.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# -------------------------------------------
# Task 2: Welcome Message
# -------------------------------------------
# Display a professional welcome message when the program starts,
# making it clear what the system is and who it’s for.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 3: Main Menu
# -------------------------------------------
# Create a looping menu that allows the user to interact with the program.
# Include clear options for different actions and ensure the menu
# continues to appear until the user decides to exit.
#
# Think about how you will capture and validate the user’s input.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 4: Logging a Call
# -------------------------------------------
# Design a process that allows the user to record the details of a new call.
# Consider what information should be collected and how to ensure data quality.
# Validation should be used to prevent incomplete or invalid entries.
# Add each completed record to your main data storage.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 5: Viewing Logged Calls
# -------------------------------------------
# Allow the user to view all stored calls in a clear, readable format.
# Consider what happens if there are no calls to display.
# Make the output look professional and easy to interpret.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 6: Exiting and Error Handling
# -------------------------------------------
# Ensure the program can exit gracefully with a suitable message.
# Handle invalid input choices or unexpected user behaviour
# without causing the program to crash.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 7: Testing and Comments
# -------------------------------------------
# Test your program thoroughly:
# - Try different kinds of input and edge cases
# - Check that validation works
# - Ensure the program behaves correctly at all times
#
# Add clear comments to explain your logic and code structure.
# Make sure variable names and formatting follow good Python practices.
#
# Commit your final version when finished.
# -------------------------------------------


# -------------------------------------------
# Extension Ideas (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------
# If you finish early, you could:
# - Add a search or filter feature
# - Include priority levels for calls
# - Record the time each call was created
# - Allow editing or deleting of records
# -------------------------------------------
