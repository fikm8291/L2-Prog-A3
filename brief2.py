# -------------------------------------------
# Task 8: Testing and Comments
# -------------------------------------------
# Test your program thoroughly:
# - Try different inputs, including edge cases
# - Test validation and search features
# - Check that menus and options behave as expected
#
# Add comments explaining how your code works.
# Make sure your variable names are clear and consistent with Python conventions.
#
# Commit your final version when finished.
# -------------------------------------------


# -------------------------------------------
# Extension Ideas (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------
# If you finish early, you could:
# - Add date/time stamps when items are logged
# - Include a “claimed” or “returned” status for items
# - Add more search options (e.g. by colour or location)
# - Create categories for different item types
