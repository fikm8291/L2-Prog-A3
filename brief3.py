# Think carefully about how to structure your code, validate user input,
# and present information clearly to the user.
#
# Remember to save, stage, commit, and push after completing each task.
# -------------------------------------------

# TODO
# -------------------------------------------
# 1. Delete the other briefs' Python files inside this repository.
# 2. Rename this file to your own program's name (e.g. marks_tracker.py)
# 3. Run:
#    git add .
#    git commit -m "Started project"
#    git push origin main

# Task 1: Data Storage
# -------------------------------------------
# Decide how your program will store all student progress records.
# Each record should capture key information about an individual student.
# Choose an appropriate data structure and initialise it.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# -------------------------------------------
# Task 2: Welcome Message
# -------------------------------------------
# Display a professional welcome message when the program starts.
# Make it clear what the system is and who it’s designed for.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 3: Main Menu
# -------------------------------------------
# Create a looping menu that allows the user to interact with the program.
# Include clear options for key actions such as adding records,
# viewing records, calculating class averages, and exiting.
#
# The menu should continue to display until the user chooses to exit.
# Make sure inputs are validated so the program doesn’t crash.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# -------------------------------------------
# Task 4: Recording Student Progress
# -------------------------------------------
# Design a process that lets the user enter and store details about a student’s progress.
# Decide which information is necessary and how to ensure it is valid.
# Validation is essential – make sure only appropriate values are accepted.
# Add each valid record to your main data storage.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 5: Viewing All Student Records
# -------------------------------------------
# Allow the user to view all stored student records clearly.
# Include all relevant information and make the display professional and easy to read.
# Consider how the program should behave if no records have been added yet.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 6: Class Summary or Averages
# -------------------------------------------
# Create a feature that provides a summary of overall student progress.
# You might calculate an average score or produce other useful insights.
# Think carefully about how to handle cases where no data is available.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 7: Exiting and Error Handling
# -------------------------------------------
# Ensure the program can exit gracefully with a suitable message.
# Handle invalid menu choices and other unexpected inputs
# without causing the program to crash.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 8: Testing and Comments
# -------------------------------------------
# Test your program thoroughly:
# - Try adding multiple students
# - Check validation by entering invalid data
# - Test menu navigation and exit behaviour
# - Ensure calculations and displays work as expected
#
# Add clear comments explaining your code.
# Make sure variable names are descriptive and follow Python conventions.
#
# Commit your final version when finished.
# -------------------------------------------


# -------------------------------------------
# Extension Ideas (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------
# If you finish early, you could:
# - Add a search feature for specific students
# - Include highest and lowest scores
# - Support multiple subjects or assessments
# - Produce simple performance summaries or reports
