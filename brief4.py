# Assessment 3: Event Registration App
# Greater Manchester Community Centre (Brief 4)
# -------------------------------------------
# This program helps manage event registrations in a clear and structured way.
# Think carefully about data design, input validation, and user experience.
#
# Remember to save, stage, commit, and push after completing each task.
# -------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------
# TODO
# -------------------------------------------
# 1. Delete the other briefs' Python files inside this repository.
# 2. Rename this file to your own program's name (e.g. tax_calculator.py)
# 3. Run:
#    git add .
#    git commit -m "Started project"
#    git push origin main
# -------------------------------------------


# -------------------------------------------
# Task 1: Data Storage
# -------------------------------------------
# Decide how to store all event registration records.
# Each record should capture key details about an attendee and their chosen event.
# Choose a clear and efficient data structure, then initialise it.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Task 2: Welcome Message
# -------------------------------------------
# Display a friendly, professional welcome message when the program starts.
# Make it clear what the system is and who it’s for.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 3: Main Menu
# -------------------------------------------
# Create a main menu that allows users to interact with the program.
# Include clear options such as:
# - Register for an event
# - View all attendees
# - Exit the program
#
# The menu should repeat until the user chooses to exit.
# Make sure invalid choices don’t cause the program to crash.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 4: Register for an Event
# -------------------------------------------
# Allow the user to enter details for a new registration.
# Gather essential information such as the attendee’s name, age, and chosen event.
# Apply suitable validation (e.g. no blanks, sensible age range, valid input types).
# Once valid, store the registration in your main data storage and confirm success.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 5: View All Registrations
# -------------------------------------------
# Display a clear, readable list of all registered attendees.
# Include their key details and show the total number of registrations.
# Consider how the program should respond if there are no registrations yet.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 6: Exiting and Error Handling
# -------------------------------------------
# Provide a clear exit option that closes the program politely.
# Handle invalid menu selections or unexpected input without crashing.
#
# Commit your progress after completing this task.

# Your code here:



# -------------------------------------------
# Task 7: Testing and Comments
# -------------------------------------------
# Test your program thoroughly:
# - Add multiple registrations
# - Check validation by entering invalid data
# - Test menu behaviour and exit handling
# - Test viewing and counting registrations
#
# Add clear comments explaining your code and follow Python naming conventions.
#
# Commit your final version when finished.
# -------------------------------------------


# -------------------------------------------
# Extension Ideas (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------
# If you finish early, you could:
# - Add a feature to list available events
# - Track how many people registered for each event
# - Add capacity limits for certain events
# - Allow users to cancel a registration
# - Sort or filter attendees by event or age
